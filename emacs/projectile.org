* Workspaces

- there are issues with getting the root folder set properly, even when adding a project manually via ~SPC p a~
  - it seems to keep reverting to a folder that emacs was started from or possibly where a ~.git~ file is saved
  - things work a bit better if a ~.git~ folder is found in the root
- spaces are saved inside =~.emacs.d/.local/etc/workspaces/_workspaces/= elisp file
- each space has it's own ~(defpersp)~ function
- it should be possible to just create a workspace, save it and then manually fix the root folder by editing the ~last-project-root~ inside ~(def-params)~ declaration

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(def-params
  ((persp-file . "/Users/thlorenz/emacs/doom-emacs/.local/etc/workspaces/_workspaces")
   (last-project-root . "/Volumes/d/dev/cy/cypress-node/cypress-node/packages/script-cache/"))) nil nil nil)
#+END_SRC
  
- when saving a workspace and including perspectives it fails a lot of times
  - sometimes trying again after switching a buffer works
  - saving one workspace while being in another works best

* Project Info

- ~SPC p t~ (magit-todos-list) show todos in project
- (projectile-project-info) get root dir of current project
  
* Project Navigation

- ~SPC p F~ (doom/find-file-in-other-project PROJECT-ROOT) (projectile-find-file) in a project we can select 
  - it seems as if the global project is then set to that project at least when in a buffer that has a file below the project folder
- (projectile-find-file-in-known-projects)
- ~SPC p b~ (projectile-switch-to-buffer) Switch to a buffer part of current project

** Customize Project Root Files

[[https://docs.projectile.mx/en/latest/projects/#customizing-project-root-files][docs]]

*** Customize how project root is identified

- ~:customize-group RET projectile RET~ to customize project root files
- ~projectile-project-root-files~
- ~projectile-project-root-files-top-down-recurring~
- ~projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up~
  ~~projectile-project-root-files-functions~
  
* Project Actions

- ~SPC s p~ find string inside project files
- ~SPC p s~ save project files
